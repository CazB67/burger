The task was to create a burger logger with MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and a homemade ORM following the MVC design pattern; and using Node and MySQL to query and route data, and Handlebars to generate HTML.

Eat-Da-Burger! is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat. Whenever a user submits a burger's name, the app will display the burger on the left side of the page -- waiting to be devoured. Each burger in the waiting area also has a 'Devour it!' button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page. The app stores every burger in a database, whether devoured or not.
